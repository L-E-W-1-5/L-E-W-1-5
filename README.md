## Hi i'm Lewis Wootton, an aspiring Full Stack Developer.

Currently enrolled in the school of code, learning about full stack web development.

I enjoy continuous learning and I am interested in roles that reflect this. My time at the School of Code also showed me the benefits of collaboration and pair-programming and this is important for me moving forwards. I am open to learning new technologies and skills and I believe I would be an ideal candidate for any junior developer role!
